# Bytecode Reference

## Notation

- Words inside square brackets represent data stored in the bytecode directly after the insruction. For example `function [address]` represents that the `function` instruction should be followed by an address.
- Stack manipulation is listed in parenthesis. For example, the Binary Additional instructio coud be represented as `(a, b -> c)` representing that it pops the top two items from the stack and pushes a single item to the stack.

## Chain comparators

To start a set of chain comparisons, the number 1 is pushed to the stack, followed by the first operand.

Each of the chain comparitor instructions do the following:
- pop form the stack and store in R
- pop form the stack and store in L
- pop from the stack and store in C
- push ((L compare R) and C) to the stack (logical and)
- push R to stack

To end a set of chain comparisons, the top item of the stack (which would be the very last R) is popped.

## Functions

### Function call bytecode

push the function to the stack
push the arguments to the stack (note that this might change depending on whether the function is a macro or not)
argument list end instruction [number of arguments]

### Entering a function

push return address
push return scope
If results are going to be cached, push cache key. 'NONE' can be pushed if the function has a `STORE_IN_CACHE` instruction but you want to prevent caching.
goto function bytecode

After the `RETURN` function is executed, the address and scope will be reset and the top of the stack will be the result of the function.

### Function definition

#### Creating a function object

`FUNCTION_NORMAL`
start_address

#### Function definiton in the byte code

 - start address (be aware that this takes up a byte, and it's empty)
- number of parameters
- 1 if variadic, 0 otherwise
- 1 if macro, 0 otherwise
- executable code starts here
- If not a macro: `STORE_IN_CACHE` insturction
- `RETURN` instruction
